Audio Visualization Using Data Science with Python

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing audio signals using Python and data science techniques. The goal is to transform raw audio data into meaningful visual representations that help understand the structure, frequency components, and temporal patterns of sound.

Key Objectives:

Read and process audio files (e.g., .wav, .mp3)

Extract audio features like waveform, amplitude, frequency, and spectrogram

Visualize these features to gain insights into the audio content


Technologies & Libraries Used:

Python: Core programming language

Librosa: For audio analysis and feature extraction

NumPy/Pandas: For data handling and computation

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For plotting visualizations

SciPy: For signal processing tasks



Types of Visualizations:

Waveform Plot: Shows how audio amplitude varies over time

Spectrogram: Displays the spectrum of frequencies over time

Chroma Features: Visualizes pitch classes and musical notes

MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients): Captures the timbral texture of the audio

Tempo/Rhythm Plots: Detects beats and tempo variations


Applications:

Music genre classification

Voice and speech analysis


This project is ideal for combining machine learning, digital signal processing, and data visualization, offering a strong portfolio piece for those interested in audio analysis or creative data science applications.
